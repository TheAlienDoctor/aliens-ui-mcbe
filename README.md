# Alien's UI Pack
## Information
This pack tweaks the Bedrock Edition UI in mostly minor ways to how Alien likes it.
## Feature list
- Quicker screen animations
- Partially removed background from settings
- Fully removed background from pause screen and inventory screens
- Removed marketplace button in pause screen
- Added a pointless Alien button on pause screen and play screen
- Removed vignette
- Removed background from chat and position (Same as my clearchat pack)
- Removed the background of the paper doll in inventory, as sometimes it would mess up skins (including the shoes of mine)
- Added toggleable co-ordinates and day counter (same as my standalone toggle co-ords pack). This means paper doll will not work with this pack. You can toggle co-ords using f8
- Removed how to play button from inventory
- Removed background of sidebar scoreboards
- No nether particles, and smaller rain particles from my better rain pack
- Removed background of item name (the one that appears when you select it on your hotbar)
- Move custom server list above featured server list
- Added some fun splash screen and loading messages related to me :D
- Honestly there might be something I missed, I didn't keep a list of features when I made this :facepalm:
